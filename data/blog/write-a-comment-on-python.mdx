Comments (comments) are codes in the python script that are not executed or not run the engine. Comments are only used to mark or provide written information on the script.

Comments are commonly used to let others understand what the script is doing. Or to remind the programmer himself if one day re -editing the script.

To use your comments, just write a fence mark `#`, followed by your comments.

Below is an example of using comments on Python

```python:comment.py
#This is a comment

# This article will not be executed

#comment with a fence sign can only be used
#for
#one
#line

"""
Writing more than one line of comments, namely
by using quotes two 3 times and
closed with quotes two 3 times too
"""

print ("Hello World") #this is also a comment

#print ("welcome")

# Comments can contain special characters!@# $%^& \*(),./; '[] \

#printing name
print("Ilham Kurniawan")

#printing numbers/integer
print(123)
```

When you run the script above, you will see the output in the form of 'Hello World', 'Ilham Kurniawan' and '123', because the writing/comments written are not executed.
