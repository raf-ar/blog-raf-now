 A data type is a medium or memory on a computer that is used to store information.

 Python itself has a data type that is quite unique when we compare it with other programming languages.

 Here are the data types of the Python programming language:

 |  Data Type   |  examples                    |  explanations                                                                            |  
 |  ----------- |  --------------------------- |  --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
 |  boolean     |  `TRUE` or` FALSE`           |  `TRUE` certifying that worth` 1`, or `FALSE` valuable one` 0`                           |
 |  string      |  `" Come learn Python "`     |  Stating character / phrase can include letters numbers, etc. (flanked by the `" `or` `) |
 |  integer     |  `25` or` 1209`              |  Stated integer                                                                          |
 |  float       |  `` 3.14` or 0.99`           |  Stating number that has comma                                                           |
 |  hexadecimal |  `` 9a` or 1d3`              |  Stating numbers in hex format (based on the number 16)                                  |
 |  complex     |  `` 1 + 5j                   |  Stating couples real and imaginary numbers                                              |
 |  list        |  `[ 'Xyz', 786, 2:23]`       |  Data strands that store various types of data and contents can be changed               |
 |  tuple       |  `( 'Xyz', 768, 2.23)`       |  Data strands that store various types of data but its contents can not be changed       |
 |  dictionary  |  `{ 'Name': 'adi', 'id': 2} '|  Data strands that store various types of data such as bookmarks and value pairs         |

 To try various data types, please try the Python script below.

```python:data-type.py
 #boolean datatype
 #There are 2 types of boolean data, namely true or false
 print(true)
 print(false)

 #String datatype
 #begins and ends with double quotes " " or single quote ' '
 print("Let's learn Python")
 print('Learn Python Very Easy')

 #Integer data type
 #integers
 print(20)

 #Float datatype
 #decimal number
 print(3.14)

 #Hexadecimal data type
 #hexadecinal numbers
 print(9a)

 #Complex data types
 #complex number
 print(5h)

 #List datatype
 # begins and ends with square brackets [ ]
 print([1,2,3,4,5])
 print(["one", "two", "three"])

 #Tuple datatype
 # begins and ends with parentheses ( )
 print((1,2,3,4,5))
 print(("one", "two", "three"))

 #Dictionary data types
 #begins and ends with curly braces { }
 print({"name":"Budi", 'age':20})

 #Dictionary data type is entered into the biodata variable
 biodata = {"name":"Andi", 'age':21} #biography variable initialization process
 print(biodata) #printing process of biodata variable which contains data type Dictionary
 print(type(biodata)) # function to check the type of data type.  will show <class 'dict'> which means dict is a data type dictionary
```
