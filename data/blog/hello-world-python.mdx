Python language syntax is almost the same as programming languages ​​in general such as Java or PHP.

### Basic Syntax

Below is an example of a Python function used to print. In Python to print just use the `print()` function, where something to be printed must be placed between the opening and closing brackets, even in Python 2.x version you don't have to use curly braces, just separate them with spaces.
If you want to print the String data type directly, you have to put it in quotes first.

```
print("Hello World")
```

When you run the script above, you will see the output of the text `Hello World`

### Python Case Sensitivity

Python is case sensitive, this means that uppercase and lowercase letters are different. For example if you use the print function with lowercase letters `print()` will work. On the other hand, if you capitalize `Print()` or `PRINT()` , an error message will appear.
This rule applies to variable or function names'Introduction to functions'Introduction
