 Variables are memory locations reserved for storing values.  This means that when you create a variable you reserve some space in memory.  Variables store data that is carried out during program execution, which later the contents of these variables can be changed by certain operations on programs that use variables.

 Variables can store various types of data.  In Python programming, variables are dynamic, meaning that Python variables do not need to be declared a specific data type and Python variables can be changed when the program is run.

 Writing PythoPythonn variables itself also has certain rules, namely:

 1. The first character must be a letter or underscore `_`
 2. Subsequent characters can be letters, underscore `_` or numbers
 3. Characters in variable names are case sensitive.  This means that lowercase and uppercase letters are distinguished.  For example, the variables `Firstname` and `Firstname` are different variables.

 To start creating variables in Python, it's very easy, you just write the variable and then fill it with a value by adding an equal sign `=` followed by the value you want to enter.

 Below is an example of using variables in the Python programming language

 ``` python:variable.py
 #process of entering data into variables
 name = "John Doe"
 #process print variable
 print(name)

 #values ​​and data types in variables can be changed
 age = 20 #initial value
 print(age) #print age value
 type(age) #check age data type
 age = "twenty one" #value after change
 print(age) #print age value
 type(age) #check age data type

 firstname = "Budi"
 lastname = "Susanto"
 name = Firstname + " " + Lastname
 age = 22
 hobby = "Swimming"
 print("Biodata\n", name, "\n", age, "\n", hobbies)

 #examples of other variables
 thisvariable = "Hello"
 this_also_variable = "Hi"
 _inivariable also = "Hi"
 thisvariable222 =Python

 length = 10
 width = 5
 area = length * width
 print(area)
 ```
