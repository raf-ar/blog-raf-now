üëã Hello, and welcome to my first post. I make this a place where I will share, learn and teach the little I have learned alongside amazing people.

## Motivation

I am starting this site with a purpose - to perpetuate a meaning for my life, and to be a home for my mind. Troubled days with a sense of a better future, I walk with that in mind and this project I have been building for a while, and it has allowed me to open my mind and think outside the box in many ways.

From the people I have met, the interviews I have participated in, and the whole process of learning and growing, it has a power to move me forward.

## Changes

Well, as you may have realized by now, this site will not be a place just to talk about programming, architecture or development in totality, just like all the changes that have been happening in my life, I have been trying to develop and improve my 'soft skills' as much as my 'hard skills'.

It is a slow and difficult to understand this process, as well as the recent company migration that I am making, everything tends to act in a common direction. I met amazing people and made great friends in this process and I will miss them a lot.

## The Beginning

I have many ideas for this space, I consider it a beginning, not only for me as a person, but also in spirit. In this whole process of self-knowledge, I have learned new languages, understanding me and others, learned about thinking differently, and had a 'boom' of thinking and acting outside the box.

Greatness from small beginnings, this is the meaning of the phrase engraved on the ring present at the beginning of the site, something that has been with me for a long time, but that begins to have a clearer meaning with each passing day.
